        <h1>Characters from Overlord</h1>
        <h3 style="color: #ffd700; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">What is Overlord?</h3>
        <p class="highlighted">“Overlord” is an amazing story written by the Japanese author Kugane Maruyama, later adapted into an anime and manga. The story takes place in the virtual reality game “Yggdrasil,” where the main character, a player who decides to stay in the game just before it shuts down, suddenly discovers that he and his entire guild have been transported to an unknown world.</p>
        <h3 style="color: #ffd700; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Season One</h3>
        <p class="highlighted">In the first season, Ainz, formerly known as Suzuki Satoru, finds himself trapped in the world of the game Yggdrasil after its sudden shutdown. Initially, Ainz explores the new rules of this world, discovering that his powers and attributes remain intact, and that NPCs have come to life. He quickly realizes that he must develop a plan to protect the Tomb of Nazarick and conquer the surrounding world. As the plot progresses, Ainz faces various challenges from interacting with local powers and factions that see him either as a threat or an opportunity.</p>
        <h3 style="color: #ffd700; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Season Two</h3>
        <p class="highlighted">In the second season, Ainz strengthens his power over Nazarick, confronting various forces and factions, including the Re-Estize Kingdom and the Holy Kingdom. His strategic actions and growing influence begin to attract interest and concerns among other powers. He implements a plan to expand Nazarick's influence, testing the loyalty of his subordinates and manipulating events from behind the scenes.</p>
        <h3 style="color: #ffd700; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Season Three</h3>
        <p class="highlighted">In the third season, Ainz becomes the Sorcerer King, expands his territory, and gains recognition as an invincible leader. His alliances, intrigues, and political maneuvers are tools to strengthen his dominance and establish an order that meets his goals. New challenges and rivals appear, but with the support of his loyal guardians, Ainz moves toward absolute hegemony, showing his uncompromising attitude in achieving his goals.</p>
        <h3 style="color: #ffd700; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Season Four</h3>
        <p class="highlighted">In the fourth season, recognized as the undisputed ruler, Ainz continues expanding the Sorcerer Kingdom. His political intrigues and diplomatic maneuvers become more complex as he strengthens relationships with neighboring kingdoms and enemies who perceive his growing power as a threat. Ainz faces new challenges, both internal and external, while trying to maintain Nazarick's unity and gain the support and respect of other nations. Meanwhile, new secrets and ancient forces begin to reveal themselves, forcing Ainz and his loyal guardians to make decisions that will determine the future of the entire world.</p>
